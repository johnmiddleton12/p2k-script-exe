# p2k-script-exe

### Description

This is a modification of the script made by [maxbrand99](https://twitter.com/maxbrand99) making it easier to use, with less installation required - original [repo](https://github.com/maxbrand99/maxbanned-p2k-script)

This was done using [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/), which allowed for bundling of the web3 python module, removing the need to build the web3 package locally or install any dependencies, such as the C++ build tools.

### Usage

1. Download [p2k.zip](https://github.com/johnmiddleton12/p2k-script-exe/releases/download/v1.0.0/p2k.zip)

2. Extract the archive

3. Change the settings in settings.txt for your keys and settings

4. Run p2k.exe

THIS WILL OVERPAY FOR GAS. I didnt feel like figuring it out at time of run, so I just defaulted to the same number. Thankfully, its matic chain so it does not really matter.

make sure you approve bananas. best option is go start a run via UI, and it will have you approve them

feel free to share this where ever, i dont particularly care...just tell them you got it from me

the only assurance i give on this code is that its not malicious, use at your own risk
